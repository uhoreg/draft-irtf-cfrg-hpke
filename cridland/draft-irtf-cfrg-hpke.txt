                      Hybrid Public Key Encryption
                      draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a scheme for hybrid public-key encryption
   (HPKE).  This scheme provides authenticated public key encryption of
   arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.  HPKE works
   for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism
   (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption
   with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.  We provide
   instantiations of the scheme using widely-used and efficient
   primitives.

1.  Introduction

   "Hybrid" public-key encryption schemes (HPKE) that combine asymmetric
   and symmetric algorithms are a substantially more efficient solution
   than traditional public key encryption techniques such as those based
   on RSA or ElGamal.  Encrypted messages convey a single ciphertext and
   authentication tag alongside a short public key, which may be further
   compressed.  The key size and computational complexity of elliptic
   curve cryptographic primitives for authenticated encryption therefore
   make it compelling for a variety of use cases.  This type of public
   key encryption has many applications in practice, for example:

   o  PGP [RFC6637]

   o  Messaging Layer Security [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol]

   o  Encrypted Server Name Indication [I-D.ietf-tls-esni]

   o  Protection of 5G subscriber identities [fiveG]

Internet-Draft                    HPKE                         July 2019


   Currently, there are numerous competing and non-interoperable
   standards and variants for hybrid encryption, including ANSI X9.63
   [ANSI], IEEE 1363a [IEEE], ISO/IEC 18033-2 [ISO], and SECG SEC 1
   [SECG].  All of these existing schemes have problems, e.g., because
   they rely on outdated primitives, lack proofs of IND-CCA2 security,
   or fail to provide test vectors.

   This document defines an HPKE scheme that provides a subset of the
   functions provided by the collection of schemes above, but specified
   with sufficient clarity that they can be interoperably implemented
   and formally verified.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Properties

   As a hybrid authentication encryption algorithm, we desire security
   against (adaptive) chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2 secure).  The
   HPKE variants described in this document achieve this property under
   the Random Oracle model assuming the gap Computational Diffie Hellman
   (CDH) problem is hard [S01].

   [[ TODO - Provide citations to these proofs once they exist ]]

4.  Notation

   The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
   operations, roles, and behaviors of HPKE:

   o  Initiator (I): Sender of an encrypted message.

   o  Responder (R): Receiver of an encrypted message.

   o  Ephemeral (E): A fresh random value meant for one-time use.

   o  "(skX, pkX)": A KEM key pair used in role X; "skX" is the private
      key and "pkX" is the public key

   o  "pk(skX)": The public key corresponding to private key "skX"

   o  "len(x)": The length of the octet string "x", expressed as a two-
      octet unsigned integer in network (big-endian) byte order

Internet-Draft                    HPKE                         July 2019


   o  "encode_big_endian(x, n)": An octet string encoding the integer
      value "x" as an n-byte big-endian value

   o  "concat(x0, ..., xN)": Concatenation of octet strings.
      "concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506"

   o  "zero(n)": An all-zero octet string of length "n". "zero(4) =
      0x00000000"

   o  "xor(a,b)": XOR of octet strings; "xor(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4".
      It is an error to call this function with two arguments of unequal
      length.

5.  Cryptographic Dependencies

   HPKE variants rely on the following primitives:

   o  A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM):

      *  GenerateKeyPair(): Generate a key pair (sk, pk)

      *  Marshal(pk): Produce a fixed-length octet string encoding the
         public key "pk"

      *  Unmarshal(enc): Parse a fixed-length octet string to recover a
         public key

      *  Encap(pk): Generate an ephemeral symmetric key and a fixed-
         length encapsulation of that key that can be decapsulated by
         the holder of the private key corresponding to pk

      *  Decap(enc, sk): Use the private key "sk" to recover the
         ephemeral symmetric key from its encapsulated representation
         "enc"

      *  AuthEncap(pkR, skI) (optional): Same as Encap(), but the
         outputs encode an assurance that the ephemeral shared key is
         known only to the holder of the private key "skI"

      *  AuthDecap(skR, pkI) (optional): Same as Decap(), but the holder
         of the private key "skR" is assured that the ephemeral shared
         key is known only to the holder of the private key
         corresponding to "pkI"

   o  A Key Derivation Function:

Internet-Draft                    HPKE                         July 2019


      *  Extract(salt, IKM): Extract a pseudorandom key of fixed length
         from input keying material "IKM" and an optional octet string
         "salt"

      *  Expand(PRK, info, L): Expand a pseudorandom key "PRK" using
         optional string "info" into "L" bytes of output keying material

      *  Nh: The output size of the Extract function

   o  An AEAD encryption algorithm [RFC5116]:

      *  Seal(key, nonce, aad, pt): Encrypt and authenticate plaintext
         "pt" with associated data "aad" using secret key "key" and
         nonce "nonce", yielding ciphertext and tag "ct"

      *  Open(key, nonce, aad, ct): Decrypt ciphertext "ct" using
         associated data "aad" with secret key "key" and nonce "nonce",
         returning plaintext message "pt" or the error value "OpenError"

      *  Nk: The length in octets of a key for this algorithm

      *  Nn: The length in octets of a nonce for this algorithm

   A set of concrete instantiations of these primitives is provided in
   Section 7.  Ciphersuite values are two octets long.

5.1.  DH-Based KEM

   Suppose we are given a Diffie-Hellman group that provides the
   following operations:

   o  GenerateKeyPair(): Generate an ephemeral key pair "(sk, pk)" for
      the DH group in use

   o  DH(sk, pk): Perform a non-interactive DH exchange using the
      private key sk and public key pk to produce a fixed-length shared
      secret

   o  Marshal(pk): Produce a fixed-length octet string encoding the
      public key "pk"

   o  Unmarshal(enc): Parse a fixed-length octet string to recover a
      public key

   Then we can construct a KEM (which we'll call "DHKEM") in the
   following way:

Internet-Draft                    HPKE                         July 2019


   def Encap(pkR):
     skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
     zz = DH(skE, pkR)
     enc = Marshal(pkE)
     return zz, enc

   def Decap(enc, skR):
     pkE = Unmarshal(enc)
     return DH(skR, pkE)

   def AuthEncap(pkR, skI):
     skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
     zz = concat(DH(skE, pkR), DH(skI, pkR))
     enc = Marshal(pkE)
     return zz, enc

   def AuthDecap(enc, skR, pkI):
     pkE = Unmarshal(enc)
     return concat(DH(skR, pkE), DH(skR, pkI))

   The GenerateKeyPair, Marshal, and Unmarshal functions are the same as
   for the underlying DH group.  The Marshal functions for the curves
   used in the ciphersuites in {#ciphersuites} are as follows:

   o  P-256: The X-coordinate of the point, encoded as a 32-octet big-
      endian integer

   o  P-521: The X-coordinate of the point, encoded as a 66-octet big-
      endian integer

   o  Curve25519: The standard 32-octet representation of the public key

   o  Curve448: The standard 56-octet representation of the public key

6.  Hybrid Public Key Encryption

   In this section, we define a few HPKE variants.  All variants take a
   recipient public key and a sequence of plaintexts "pt", and produce
   an encapsulated key "enc" and a sequence of ciphertexts "ct".  These
   outputs are constructed so that only the holder of the private key
   corresponding to "pkR" can decapsulate the key from "enc" and decrypt
   the ciphertexts.  All of the algorithms also take an "info" parameter
   that can be used to influence the generation of keys (e.g., to fold
   in identity information) and an "aad" parameter that provides
   Additional Authenticated Data to the AEAD algorithm in use.

   In addition to the base case of encrypting to a public key, we
   include two authenticated variants, one of which authenticates

   possession of a pre-shared key, and one of which authenticates
   possession of a KEM private key.  The following one-octet values will
   be used to distinguish between modes:

                           +-----------+-------+
                           | Mode      | Value |
                           +-----------+-------+
                           | mode_base | 0x00  |
                           |           |       |
                           | mode_psk  | 0x01  |
                           |           |       |
                           | mode_auth | 0x02  |
                           +-----------+-------+

   All of these cases follow the same basic two-step pattern:

   1.  Set up an encryption context that is shared between the sender
       and the recipient

   2.  Use that context to encrypt or decrypt content

   A "context" encodes the AEAD algorithm and key in use, and manages
   the nonces used so that the same nonce is not used with multiple
   plaintexts.

   The procedures described in this session are laid out in a Python-
   like pseudocode.  The ciphersuite in use is left implicit.

6.1.  Encryption to a Public Key

   The most basic function of an HPKE scheme is to enable encryption for
   the holder of a given KEM private key.  The "SetupBaseI()" and
   "SetupBaseR()" procedures establish contexts that can be used to
   encrypt and decrypt, respectively, for a given private key.

   The the shared secret produced by the KEM is combined via the KDF
   with information describing the key exchange, as well as the explicit
   "info" parameter provided by the caller.

   Note that the "SetupCore()" method is also used by the other HPKE
   variants describe below.  ~~~~~ def SetupCore(mode, secret,
   kemContext, info): context = concat(ciphersuite, mode,
   len(kemContext), kemContext, len(info), info) key = Expand(secret,
   concat("hpke key", context), Nk) nonce = Expand(secret, concat("hpke
   nonce", context), Nn) return Context(key, nonce)

Internet-Draft                    HPKE                         July 2019


   def SetupBase(pkR, zz, enc, info): kemContext = concat(enc, pkR)
   secret = Extract(zero(Nh), zz) return SetupCore(mode_base, secret,
   kemContext, info)

   def SetupBaseI(pkR, info): zz, enc = Encap(pkR) return enc,
   SetupBase(pkR, zz, enc, info)

   def SetupBaseR(enc, skR, info): zz = Decap(enc, skR) return
   SetupBase(pk(skR), zz, enc, info) ~~~~~

   Note that the context construction in the SetupCore procedure is
   equivalent to serializing a structure of the following form in the
   TLS presentation syntax:

   struct {
       uint16 ciphersuite;
       uint8 mode;
       opaque kemContext<0..255>;
       opaque info<0..255>;
   } HPKEContext;

6.2.  Authentication using a Pre-Shared Key

   This variant extends the base mechansism by allowing the recipient to
   authenticate that the sender possessed a given pre-shared key (PSK).
   We assume that both parties have been provisioned with both the PSK
   value "psk" and another octet string "pskID" that is used to identify
   which PSK should be used.

   The primary differences from the base case are:

   o  The PSK is used as the "salt" input to the KDF (instead of 0)

   o  The PSK ID is added to the context string used as the "info" input
      to the KDF

   This mechanism is not suitable for use with a low-entropy password as
   the PSK.  A malicious recipient that does not possess the PSK can use
   decryption of a plaintext as an oracle for performing offline
   dictionary attacks.

   def SetupPSK(pkR, psk, pskID, zz, enc, info):
     kemContext = concat(enc, pkR, pskID)
     secret = Extract(psk, zz)
     return SetupCore(mode_psk, secret, kemContext, info)

   def SetupPSKI(pkR, psk, pskID, info):
     zz, enc = Encap(pkR)
     return enc, SetupPSK(pkR, psk, pskID, zz, enc, info)

   def SetupPSKR(enc, skR, psk, pskID, info):
     zz = Decap(enc, skR)
     return SetupPSK(pk(skR), psk, pskID, zz, enc, info)

6.3.  Authentication using an Asymmetric Key

   This variant extends the base mechansism by allowing the recipient to
   authenticate that the sender possessed a given KEM private key.  This
   assurance is based on the assumption that "AuthDecap(enc, skR, pkI)"
   produces the correct shared secret only if the encapsulated value
   "enc" was produced by "AuthEncap(pkR, skI)", where "skI" is the
   private key corresponding to "pkI".  In other words, only two people
   could have produced this secret, so if the recipient is one, then the
   sender must be the other.

   The primary differences from the base case are:

   o  The calls to "Encap" and "Decap" are replaced with calls to
      "AuthEncap" and "AuthDecap".

   o  The initiator public key is added to the context string used as
      the "info" input to the KDF

   Obviously, this variant can only be used with a KEM that provides
   "AuthEncap()" and "AuthDecap()" procuedures.

   This mechanism authenticates only the key pair of the initiator, not
   any other identity.  If an application wishes to authenticate some
   other identity for the sender (e.g., an email address or domain
   name), then this identity should be included in the "info" parameter
   to avoid unknown key share attacks.

   def SetupAuthI(pkR, skI, info):

   def SetupAuthR(enc, skR, pkI, info):
     zz = AuthDecap(enc, skR, pkI)
     return SetupAuth(pk(skR), pkI, zz, enc, info)

6.4.  Encryption and Decryption

   HPKE allows multiple encryption operations to be done based on a
   given setup transaction.  Since the public-key operations involved in
   setup are typically more expensive than symmetric encryption or
   decryption, this allows applications to "amortize" the cost of the
   public-key operations, reducing the overall overhead.

   In order to avoid nonce reuse, however, this decryption must be
   stateful.  Each of the setup procedures above produces a context
   object that stores the required state:

   o  The AEAD algorithm in use

   o  The key to be used with the AEAD algorithm

   o  A base nonce value

   o  A sequence number (initially 0)

   All of these fields except the sequence number are constant.  The
   sequence number is used to provide nonce uniqueness: The nonce used
   for each encryption or decryption operation is the result of XORing
   the base nonce with the current sequence number, encoded as a big-
   endian integer of the same length as the nonce.  Implementations MAY
   use a sequence number that is shorter than the nonce (padding on the
   left with zero), but MUST return an error if the sequence number
   overflows.

   Each encryption or decryption operation increments the sequence
   number for the context in use.  A given context SHOULD be used either
   only for encryption or only for decryption.

   It is up to the application to ensure that encryptions and
   decryptions are done in the proper sequence, so that the nonce values
   used for encryption and decryption line up.

   def Context.Nonce(seq):

     return xor(self.nonce, encSeq)

     ct = Seal(self.key, self.Nonce(self.seq), aad, pt)
     self.seq += 1
     return ct

   def Context.Open(aad, ct):
     pt = Open(self.key, self.Nonce(self.seq), aad, ct)
     if pt == OpenError:
       return OpenError
     self.seq += 1
     return pt

7.  Ciphersuites

   The HPKE variants as presented will function correctly for any
   combination of primitives that provides the functions described
   above.  In this section, we provide specific instantiations of these
   primitives for standard groups, including: Curve25519, Curve448
   [RFC7748], and the NIST curves P-256 and P-512.

   For the NIST curves P-256 and P-521, the Marshal function of the DH
   scheme produces the normal (non-compressed) representation of the
   public key, according to [SECG].  When these curves are used, the
   recipient of an HPKE ciphertext MUST validate that the ephemeral
   public key "pkE" is on the curve.  The relevant validation procedures
   are defined in [keyagreement]

   For the CFRG curves Curve25519 and Curve448, the Marshal function is
   the identity function, since these curves already use fixed-length
   octet strings for public keys.

   The values "Nk" and "Nn" for the AEAD algorithms referenced above are
   as follows:

                      +------------------+----+----+
                      | AEAD             | Nk | Nn |
                      +------------------+----+----+
                      | AES-GCM-128      | 16 | 12 |
                      |                  |    |    |
                      | AES-GCM-256      | 32 | 12 |
                      |                  |    |    |
                      | ChaCha20Poly1305 | 32 | 12 |

Appendix A.  Possible TODOs

   The following extensions might be worth specifying:

   o  Multiple recipients - It might be possible to add some
      simplifications / assurances for the case where the same value is
      being encrypted to multiple recipients.

   o  Test vectors - Obviously, we can provide decryption test vectors
      in this document.  In order to provide known-answer tests, we
      would have to introduce a non-secure deterministic mode where the
      ephemeral key pair is derived from the inputs.  And to do that
      safely, we would need to augment the decrypt function to detect
      the deterministic mode and fail.

   o  A reference implementation in hacspec or similar
